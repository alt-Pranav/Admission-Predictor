# Admission-Predictor

<font size=5>
  This project is created with reference to https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/09/integrating-machine-learning-into-web-applications-with-flask/
  
  Within this project, I have implemented Linear Regression using sci-kit learn package in python as the backend. Using the Admission Predictor dataset sourced from Kaggle, it will predict the chance of admit based on the given parameters.
